# Explanation of the `buscarEnGoogle` Function

The `FindInGoogle` function uses Puppeteer to perform a Google search for a given keyword and extracts the titles of the first three search results.

## Step-by-Step Description

1. **Initialize Puppeteer:**
   The function starts by requiring Puppeteer and launching a browser instance in non-headless mode to allow observation of the browser actions.

2. **Open a New Page:**
   A new page is created in the browser instance.

3. **Navigate to Google:**
   The function navigates to the Google homepage.

4. **Accept Conditions:**
   The function waits for the consent button to appear, then clicks it to accept Google's conditions.

5. **Perform the Search:**
   The function waits for the search input to be visible, types the given keyword, and presses 'Enter' to perform the search. It then waits for the navigation to complete.

6. **Extract Titles:**
   The function evaluates the page to extract the titles of the first three search results using a `querySelectorAll` to find `h3` elements and returns their inner text.

7. **Error Handling:**
   If any errors occur during the process, they are caught and logged to the console.

8. **Close the Browser:**
   Finally, the browser instance is closed.

## Example Usage

In the example usage, the function searches for the keyword 'ping-pong' on Google and logs the titles of the first three search results.
