## Test Overview

This README outlines the tasks and structure for a two-part coding test.

## Structure of the Test

### First Test Delivery
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Tasks:**
  - **Task 1:** Basic Web Scraping
  - **Task 2:** Longest Consecutive Sequence
  - **Task 3 Part 1:** Code Refactoring (Analysis)

### Second Test Delivery
- **Duration:** No time limit
- **Tasks:**
  - **Task 1 Improvements:** Refine the solution for Task 1
  - **Task 2 Improvements:** Refine the solution for Task 2
  - **Task 3 Part 2:** Implement the improvements proposed in Task 3 Part 1

## Task Details

### TASK 1: Basic Web Scraping
- **Objective:** Write a script that extracts the titles of the first three search results from Google given a keyword.
- **Example:**
  - **Input:** `ping-pong`
  - **Output:**
    - Table tennis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
    - Online Ping Pong Catalog
    - Ping pong - Sports: Sports and outdoors: Table tennis sets ...

### TASK 2: Longest Consecutive Sequence
- **Objective:** Identify the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array of integers.
- **Complexity Requirement:** O(n)
- **Example:**
  - **Input:** `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`
  - **Output:** 4
  - **Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and its length is 4.

### TASK 3: Code Refactoring
#### Part 1
- **Objective:** List improvements for the provided JavaScript code using the Puppeteer library.
- **Code Sample:** (provided in the test description)
- **Note:** Do not write any code; just describe potential improvements.

#### Part 2
- **Objective:** Implement the improvements suggested in Part 1.
- **Requirements:** The code does not need to be fully functional but should conceptually address the improvements listed in Part 1. Mention any frameworks or libraries assumed to be installed.
