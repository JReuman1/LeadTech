## Puppeteer Script Improvements

Here is a list of suggested improvements to enhance the Puppeteer scraping script:

### 1. **Exception Handling**
   - Implement `try-catch` blocks to handle potential errors during browser operations and page navigation, enhancing error reporting and stability.

### 2. **Proper Await Usage**
   - Ensure that `.click()` operations are awaited properly to prevent race conditions. Current usage might proceed before the click action completes.

### 3. **Safe Browser Closure**
   - Use a `finally` block to guarantee that the browser closes correctly, regardless of whether the preceding operations succeed or fail.

### 4. **Element Existence Validation**
   - Before performing actions like clicking or extracting text, check that the elements actually exist to prevent runtime errors.

### 5. **Refactoring for Reusability**
   - Break down the script into reusable functions for opening pages, extracting text, etc., making the code more modular and maintainable.

### 6. **Custom Timeout Implementation**
   - Implement maximum wait times instead of indefinite waiting for selectors, preventing the script from hanging indefinitely.

### 7. **Constants for Selectors**
   - Define constants for CSS selectors used in the script, simplifying updates and maintenance if the web page layout changes.

### 8. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Improve logging messages to provide more context about the operations performed and their outcomes, aiding in development and debugging.

### 9. **Browser Configuration**
   - Explicitly set browser options in `puppeteer.launch()`, such as headless mode and viewport settings, to ensure consistent script behavior.

### 10. **Documentation and Comments**
   - Add descriptive comments and documentation to key functions and code sections to clarify the purpose and design decisions of the code.

These improvements will make the script more robust, understandable, and easier to maintain, while also providing a better experience when handling errors and exceptions during the scraping process.
